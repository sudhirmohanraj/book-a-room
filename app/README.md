Taking it Forward
1. Make Images Clickable
2. Let the User know the response from book button click using a Toast message
3. Clean up the UI a bit to arrange the spots, names and button click
4. Handle Error back from Servers for Failures
5. Add a Fragment instead of directly doing all the work on activity.
